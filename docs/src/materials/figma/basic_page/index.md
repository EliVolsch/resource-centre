We will cover the following consepts:
- [Creating a basic layout]()
- [Creating a navbar]()

### Creating a basic layout
When you create a design it is important to considder the sise of your canvas. In Figma our canvas is called a `Frame`. A frame defines the basic size of the screen and allows us to present the design as if it is a fully working web page. Once all design elements have been created we can simply move them to the frame. To give us an idea of what our target audince might be using we can google for [the most common screen sizes](https://www.google.com/search?q=most+common+screen+sises&oq=most+common+screen+sises&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i13i512l3j0i22i30l6.5984j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). Armed with this information we can now start creating a design.

> **Note:** *At the time of writing this tutorial the mos common screen size was 1920x1080, and is what will be used in this tutorial.*

1. To start we can open a new blank canvas on figma. I'll create a place holder frame for our contnet

Let take a brief moment beofre we get worked up to considder what our web page should liik like. With almost all pages we have some key elements present. We have some form of navigation, some content and links to other web pages like social media or about pages. I went ahead and created a mind map of what our basic web page should look like using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). this will give us some clarity on what we shoul considder to be important and what is not as important.

Armed wtih this knowlege we know we shoul account for at least 3 elements:
- Buttons
- Navbar
- Images - spesifically logo's

we should also account for adidtional pages:
- Login
- Register
- Contact Us
